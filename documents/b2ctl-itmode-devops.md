# b2ctl (IT-mode) — DevOps Guide

Operational reference for the IT-mode/HBA build: every external command it
runs, how each output is parsed, the scan pipeline, the safety model, and the
deltas from the RAID-mode build. Audience: whoever maintains or debugs b2ctl on
the R620s.

---

## 1. Environment assumptions

- PERC H710 mini crossflashed to **IT mode** → LSI SAS9207-8i (SAS2308),
  firmware `0x2214` IT. No RAID controller CLI; disks are raw `/dev/sd*`.
- Proxmox VE on ZFS-on-root (`rpool` mirror) + a data pool (`tank`, RAID10 =
  striped mirrors). Pools created with `/dev/disk/by-id/ata-*` members,
  `ashift=12`, `compression=lz4`, `atime=off`, `xattr=sa`.
- Python **stdlib only** (no pip deps). Runs as root.
- Required binaries: `smartctl`, `zpool`, `lsblk`. Optional: `sas2ircu`
  (bay numbers only), `ledmon`/`ledctl` (nicer locate LEDs), `wipefs`/`sgdisk`
  (wipe action). LED locate works without any of them via the dd fallback.

There is intentionally **no storcli/perccli and no `smartctl -d megaraid`** —
those only work behind a RAID controller and are removed in this build.

## 2. Module map

| module | responsibility | external commands |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `common.py` | colours, `run()`/`run_check()`, `Disk` model, `assess()` | none |
| `spec.py` | load/lookup TBW ratings (`ssd_spec.json`) | none |
| `hba.py` | enumerate disks, by-id index, bay map + **remap** | `lsblk`, `sas2ircu` |
| `locate.py` | device-based LED locate (ledctl -> dd), timed | `ledctl`, `dd` |
| `smart.py` | direct SMART read + parse, endurance | `smartctl` |
| `zfs.py` | pool/topology parse, membership, actions | `zpool`, `wipefs`, `sgdisk` |
| `core.py` | the `scan()` pipeline | (composes the above) |
| `ui.py` | table / pools / details / new-disk rendering | none |
| `watch.py` | interactive select()-loop, event + command handlers | `lsblk` (poll) |
| `cli.py` | argparse, subcommand dispatch, `--locate` blink | — |

`run()` is list-form `subprocess.run` (no shell), 30 s timeout, returns stdout
or `''`. `run_check()` is for mutating actions: returns `(ok, stdout+stderr)`.

---

## 3. Every subprocess, and how it is parsed

### 3.1 Disk enumeration — `hba.enumerate_disks()`
```
lsblk -dnb -P -o NAME,SIZE,SERIAL,MODEL,TRAN,ROTA,TYPE
```
- `-P` emits `KEY="value"` pairs; parsed with `(\w+)="(.*?)"`. **This is
  deliberate** — positional parsing breaks because MODEL contains spaces
  (e.g. `Samsung SSD 870 EVO 1TB`).
- Keep rows where `TYPE=disk`; drop names starting with
  `loop/sr/ram/zd/dm-/md`.
- `ROTA=0` ⇒ SSD. `SIZE` is bytes. `TRAN` ⇒ iface (SATA/SAS).

### 3.2 Stable names — `hba._by_id_index()`
Walks `/dev/disk/by-id`, `realpath`s each link, and keeps the
highest-priority link per real device: `ata-` > `scsi-SATA` > `wwn-` >
`scsi-`. Skips `*-part*`. This `by_id` is what every `zpool` action uses, so a
disk keeps a stable name across reboots/reslots.

### 3.3 Physical bay — `hba.attach_bays()` / `bay_map()`
```
sas2ircu 0 DISPLAY
```
Parsed line-by-line, tracking `Enclosure #`, `Slot #`, `Serial No`; produces
`serial -> "enc:slot"`. Matched to disks by **serial**, then **remapped** to the
physical chassis label via `bay_map.json` (`hba._remap()`).

**Why remap:** Dell 12G backplanes (R620/R720) on LSI IT firmware report
scrambled slot numbers — the Dell slot-translation map is absent in LSI
firmware (a known issue; confirmed by the H710 IT-mode flash author). `bay_map.json`
takes either an explicit `{"map": {"1:0":"1:7", ...}}` (raw->physical) or a rule
`{"reverse_slots": true, "slots_per_enclosure": 8}`. No file -> identity. The bay
is **display-only** (LEDs key off the device, not the slot), so a wrong map is
cosmetic, never dangerous. Calibrate with `b2ctl locate <serial>`.

If `sas2ircu list` returns nothing the step is skipped and `bay` stays `None`.

### 3.4 SMART — `smart.read()`
```
smartctl -a /dev/sdX          # tried first (auto device type)
smartctl -a -d sat /dev/sdX   # fallback
smartctl -a -d scsi /dev/sdX  # fallback
```
- Health: `test result:\s*(\w+)` (ATA) or `SMART Health Status:` (SAS, `OK`→
  `PASSED`).
- SSD vs HDD refined from `Rotation Rate:` (`Solid State` vs `N rpm`).
- **ATA attributes** (`ATTRIBUTE_NAME` table present): id=col0, normalised
  VALUE=col3, RAW=col9.
  - wear: first of ids `[177,233,202,231,173,169,232]` → `wear_val`
  - `9`→POH, `241`→LBAs written, `5`→reallocated, `197`→pending,
    `187/188/198`→uncorrectable (max).
- **SAS** (no attribute table): `Percentage used endurance indicator` →
  `wear_val = 100 - used`; power-on hours; `write:` log line field 6 (GB) →
  LBAs; `Elements in grown defect list` → reallocated.
- Endurance: `written_tb = lba_written * 512 / 1e12`;
  `tbw_rating` from `spec.lookup(model)`;
  `end_left = clamp((rating - written)/rating * 100, 0, 100)`. HDDs force
  `wear_val=None`.

### 3.5 ZFS topology — `zfs.topology()`
```
zpool list -H -o name,size,alloc,free,health,frag,cap
zpool status -P -v <pool>      # for each pool
```
- `-P` prints full device paths (the by-id leaves). `_parse()` walks the
  `config:`→`errors:` block. A line matching the vdev regex
  (`mirror|raidz*|spare|replacing|log|cache|special|dedup`) sets the current
  vdev; a leaf line matching `<token> <STATE>` records
  `{pool, vdev, state, token}`.
- Each leaf is indexed under **both** its `-P` token and its `realpath`, so
  `attach_membership()` can match a disk by `by_id`, `dev`, or either
  realpath. That is why membership still resolves whether the pool was built
  with by-id or `/dev/sdX`.

### 3.6 Mutating actions — `zfs.*` (all via `run_check`)
| action | command |
|--------|---------|
| add spare | `zpool add <pool> spare <by-id>` |
| replace faulted | `zpool replace <pool> <old-token> <by-id>` |
| swap-to-spare | `zpool replace <pool> <member> <spare-token>` |
| demote-to-spare | `zpool detach <pool> <member>` → `zpool add <pool> spare <by-id>` |
| add mirror vdev | `zpool add <pool> mirror <a> <b>` |
| attach | `zpool attach <pool> <existing> <new>` |
| create pool | `zpool create ...` (checks `wipefs -n` for existing labels first) |
| wipe | `zpool labelclear -f <dev>` → `wipefs -a <dev>` → `sgdisk --zap-all <dev>` |

### 3.7 LED locate — `locate.py` (by DEVICE, never by slot)
`sas2ircu ... LOCATE <slot>` is **not used** — on this backplane it lights a
whole range of bays, and the slot numbers are scrambled anyway. Locate is keyed
to the `/dev/sdX` device, backend chain:
1. fallback: `dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null bs=1M` for N seconds (READ ONLY) — the
   activity LED flickers; nothing to switch off.
Default blink is 5 s then auto-stop. `b2ctl locate <bay|serial|sdX> [secs]`
resolves any identifier to the device first. `b2ctl status --locate` blinks all
at-risk disks at once (`blink_many`). **Invariant: never construct a writing
`dd` (`of=` is always `/dev/null`).**

---

## 4. The scan pipeline (`core.scan()`)

```
enumerate_disks (lsblk -P)
  → attach_bays (sas2ircu DISPLAY, by serial; remapped via bay_map.json)
  → smart.read per disk (smartctl direct)
  → attach_membership (zpool status -P, by by-id/dev/realpath)
  → assess per disk (set LEVEL + reasons)
  → sort by (bay, dev)
```

`assess()` precedence (highest wins): vdev FAULTED/UNAVAIL/REMOVED/OFFLINE or
SMART-unreadable or FAILED or bad/pending/uncorrectable>0 or endurance<10% or
wear<10% or health="GHOST" (OS rejected device) ⇒ **CRITICAL**; vdev DEGRADED or endurance<30% or wear<30% ⇒
**WARNING**; not in any pool and not a spare ⇒ **CONFIG**; else **NORMAL**.
Thresholds: `END_WARN=30`, `END_CRIT=10` in `common.py`.

Ghost disks are detected by `hba.get_ghost_disks()`. They are drives seen by the HBA but rejected by the OS (no `/dev/sdX` node). They are tagged with `dev="-"` and `health="GHOST"`.

---

## 5. The watch loop (`watch.run()`)

A single `select.select([sys.stdin], [], [], 2.0)` loop:

1. Print table + pools + details once (`_cmd_refresh`).
2. Snapshot block devices (`_block_devs()` via `lsblk -P NAME,TYPE`).
3. Each iteration:
   - If stdin is ready → read a line → dispatch `r/s/l/q`.
   - Re-snapshot devices. `new = current - baseline`,
     `gone = baseline - current`.
   - For each `gone` → `_handle_removed()` (report + reprint pool health).
   - For each `new` → `_handle_new_disk()`:
     `sleep 2` (udev/SMART settle) → `core.scan_one()` → render panel → prompt
     `[1] spare / [2] replace / [3] wipe / [s] skip` → confirm → run action.
   - `baseline = current`.

Keystrokes and hotplug share one loop with no extra deps; the 2 s `select`
timeout doubles as the poll interval. While a `_handle_new_disk` prompt is open
(blocking `input()`), polling pauses — acceptable since the operator is at the
console.

---

## 6. Safety model

- **Read path is side-effect-free.** `status` only runs `lsblk`/`smartctl`/
  `zpool status|list`/`sas2ircu DISPLAY`.
- **Every mutating action is confirmed** with a `[y/N]` prompt that names the
  target device, pool, and operation. `wipe` adds an extra warning with the
  serial.
- Actions always use the **by-id** name, never the unstable `/dev/sdX`, so a
  reslotted disk can't be acted on by accident.
- b2ctl never deletes data, never touches access controls, never edits Proxmox
  boot config. Boot-disk (rpool) replacement still needs
  `proxmox-boot-tool format/init` on the new ESP **manually** — b2ctl will
  resilver the ZFS side but does not run proxmox-boot-tool.

---

## 7. Deployment

```bash
cd codes && sudo ./install.sh
# package  -> /opt/b2ctl/b2ctl
# spec     -> /opt/b2ctl/ssd_spec.json
# launcher -> /usr/local/sbin/b2ctl  (exec env PYTHONPATH=/opt/b2ctl python3 -P -m b2ctl)
```
`ssd_spec.json` overrides/extends the built-in TBW defaults; model match is
case/space-insensitive substring. Add new SSD models here as you buy them.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

| symptom | cause / fix |
|---------|-------------|
| table empty, pools show | `lsblk` not in `-P` mode or MODEL spaces — confirm `enumerate_disks` uses `-P`; check `lsblk -dnb -P -o NAME,...` by hand |
| BAY all `-` | `sas2ircu` missing/empty; bays optional (locate still works by serial/dev) |
| BAY numbers wrong | edit `bay_map.json` (reverse rule or explicit map); recalibrate with `b2ctl locate <serial>` |
| locate lights many bays | you're on old sas2ircu-slot locate; this build uses device-based locate — rebuild/redeploy |
| POOL `-` for in-pool disk | by-id/dev mismatch — verify `zpool status -P` leaf paths resolve (`realpath`) to the same `/dev/sdX` lsblk reports |
| END(left) `N/A` on SSD | model not in `ssd_spec.json` / no `241 Total_LBAs_Written` attr; add the rating |
| `swap` says no spare | pool has no `AVAIL` spare — add one (`[1]`) first |
| action fails | read the `✗ failed: <output>` line — it's the raw `zpool` stderr |

---

## 9. Backend detection (`backend.py`)

`get_backend()` returns a cached `Backend` instance. On first call it runs
`_detect_backend()`:

| `controller.mode` config value | result |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| `"it"` | `ITBackend()` — no subprocess run |
| `"raid"` | `RaidBackend()` — no subprocess run |
| `"auto"` (default) | probe order below |

**Auto-detection probe order:**

1. `sas2ircu list` — if stdout is non-empty → `ITBackend`.
2. `storcli64 show ctrlcount` → non-empty → `RaidBackend`.
3. `storcli show ctrlcount` → non-empty → `RaidBackend`.
4. `perccli64 show ctrlcount` → non-empty → `RaidBackend`.
5. `perccli show ctrlcount` → non-empty → `RaidBackend`.
6. None found → `die()` with an install hint.

`_backend_cache` stores the result; `setup_method` in tests clears it via
`bk_mod._backend_cache = None` to keep tests isolated.

Each backend's `name` attribute is `"it"` or `"raid"` and is used by
`b2ctl check` to report which backend was detected.

---

## 10. Config file (`config.py`)

Config file: `/etc/b2ctl/config.json`. **Optional** — missing or malformed
falls back silently to all defaults. Never written by `config.py` itself;
`cli._config_init()` writes it.

### Tool path resolution — `config.tool(name)`

Priority:

1. Non-empty `tool_paths.<name>` in config file → use as-is.
2. `shutil.which(name)` → resolved absolute path.
3. Bare `name` → let the OS resolve at subprocess exec time.

The `_cache` module-level dict is populated once by `load()` on first call and
reused. Tests that need a clean state must set `cfg_mod._cache = None` in
`setup_method`.

### Subprocesses added for RAID-mode (new in v0.5.0)

| command | purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `storcli64 /c<n>/eall/sall show all` | enumerate all drives and their EID:Slot for the bay map (also works with storcli, perccli64, perccli) |
| `storcli64 /c<n>/e<enc>/s<slot> set locate start` | turn on locate LED for one drive slot |
| `storcli64 /c<n>/e<enc>/s<slot> set locate stop` | turn off locate LED for one drive slot |
| `storcli64 show ctrlcount` | probe for RAID controller presence (also used in auto-detection) |
| `sas2ircu list` | probe for IT/HBA controller presence (existing; now also used in auto-detection) |

---

## 11. Deltas from the RAID-mode build (ADR-001)

The original ADR assumed *OS on hardware RAID1, data disks behind storcli VDs,
no boot pool*. IT mode invalidates that:

- storcli backend → **HBA backend** (`hba.py`): `lsblk` + direct `smartctl` +
  `sas2ircu`, no megaraid, no VD→NAA mapping chain.
- "drive state" came from the controller; now it comes from **ZFS vdev state**
  + SMART. `CONFIG` now means "not in a pool" (was "UGood/needs config").
- locate moved from `storcli start locate` to **device-based** ledctl/dd
  (sas2ircu slot LOCATE abandoned — scrambled slots + range-lighting bug).
- New: ZFS-on-root awareness — rpool is a pool like any other, and boot-disk
  replacement defers to `proxmox-boot-tool` (documented, not automated).
- New capability: interactive hotplug watch (no analogue in the RAID build,
  where the controller handled inserts itself).

Update ADR-001 accordingly when this build supersedes the RAID-mode one.
